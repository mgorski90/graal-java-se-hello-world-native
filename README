Just playing with native compilation of simple Java SE application to native application (Linux / ELF64).

Requires JAVA_HOME to be set on graalvm-ce-java11-20.0.0 to make a native compilation work.

Stub for more sophisticated use cases in the future.

To run output execute:
$ target/./pl.mgorski.application
